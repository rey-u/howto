## Setup

### Filter preparation

**All filter inserts must be rinsed thoroughly prior to installation**

**Regular replacement of Fluval AquaClear filter inserts is essential for optimum filter performance.**  
Fluval AquaClear Foam, Carbon, and BioMax inserts should be changed alternately in order to maintain continuous biological activity. Follow individual packaging instructions for recommended replacement intervals.  
*Never replace all filtter inserts in any Fluval AquaClear power filter at the same time.*

**Fluval AquaClear Foam**: Rinse foam insert and place into filter basket first. The foam block should totally fill the bottom of the basket leaving no space between the filter basket base and sides. *Replace foam insert every 2 months.*
